2,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,0330258648,2013-08-01,10,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=0330258648,Douglas Adams,"Funny, clever and simply wonderful. The story of a regular English guy thrown into a completely bonkers life travelling through space. Memorable characters, memorable lines and immense creativity."
18,The Restaurant at the End of the Universe,9780345391810,2017-06-01,8,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9780345391810,Douglas Adams,"Second book of the Hitchhikker''s Guide to The Galaxy series. I read it a long time ago and I don''t really remember much of the specifics, but I remember enjoying it. It still had the Douglas Adams magic, something that I felt waning on the next books in the series, for some reason. Perhaps it was just my personal taste."
1,Slash,9780061351426,2013-06-01,10,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9780061351426,Slash and Anthony Bozza,The autobiography of one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. It was great to read how Guns N' Roses was formed and to experience through Slash's eyes the magic and the madness of being in it. There are some amazing (and insane) stories in this book and it is absolutely worth a read.
7,A Game of Thrones,9780553386790,2024-03-01,10,https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9780553386790,George R. R. Martin,"The first entry in the acclaimed book series that inspired the TV show Game of Thrones. I haven''t read it completely because of other priorities (such as playing video games), but it''s amazing to know more about the characters from the show. Great writing, great storytelling."
